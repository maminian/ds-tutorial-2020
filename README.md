# What is this?

This is a small repository containing links and helper code as part of my workshop in the PAC Boulder tutorial series, see https://www.colorado.edu/pac/tutorials

# Data sources

### "Iris" data set via UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository:
* Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
* Data folder ("bezdekIris.data" is the main data file): https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/

### "Wine quality" data set via UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository:
* Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
* Data folder (the two csv files): https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/

### bioRxiv novel coronavirus/SARS-CoV-2-related papers
* Link: (go to "Download CORD-19", choose the "bioRxiv/medRxiv subset"): https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research

# Helper files (use to follow along)

You might find the file `utils.py` useful for loading the datasets
in a clean way! A few Jupyter notebooks (ipynb) with some of my
own analysis offline will be provided after the talk.
