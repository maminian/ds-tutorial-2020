start coding: around 2:45pm, Apr 2

iris dataset - 
-- past experience let me do the csv reader approach after two errors
-- studying data led me to know I should skip the last row
-- some knowledge of numpy let me convert the numerical part pretty easy
-- pulled out everything into data and labels
-- Time: 2:56pm.
-- Wrote these notes down.

wine dataset - (start 2:58pm)
-- Vague memory peeking at the data => pandas.read_csv() should probably work fine
-- Attempt 1 (white wine data): oh no, the data is semicolon-separated. Loading a hundred 
    datasets before has led me to memorize optional arguments to this function.
